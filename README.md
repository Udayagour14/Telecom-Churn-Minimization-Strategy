In this article, I write about how I analysed and visualised 1000 customer data of Maven Communications, a California-based telecommunications company and the advice I gave its senior executives on minimising churn.
Every business wants to attract and retain customers. Thatâ€™s how they grow. However, as in other aspects of life, businesses lose some customers and gain others. Customer churn is the percentage of customers who discontinue their subscriptions within a period. It can also be called churn rate or rate of attrition. On the other hand, growth rate is the percentage of new subscribers who joined a company in a given period.
Churn rate is an important factor in the telecommunications industry. In most areas, many telecoms compete; thus, it is easy for subscribers to move from one company to another.
