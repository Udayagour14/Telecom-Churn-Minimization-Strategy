# Telecom-Churn-Minimization-Strategy
Customer churn is a major concern with subscription-based companies. What is it, and how can it be minimised? let dive into data.

In this article, I write about how I analysed and visualised 1000 customer data of Maven Communications, a California-based telecommunications company and the advice I gave its senior executives on minimising churn.
Every business wants to attract and retain customers. That’s how they grow. However, as in other aspects of life, businesses lose some customers and gain others. Customer churn is the percentage of customers who discontinue their subscriptions within a period. It can also be called churn rate or rate of attrition. On the other hand, growth rate is the percentage of new subscribers who joined a company in a given period.
Churn rate is an important factor in the telecommunications industry. In most areas, many telecoms compete; thus, it is easy for subscribers to move from one company to another.


## **Project Steps**

I followed the steps outlined below to arrive at the dashboard and recommendations.
1. Preliminary research
2. Data cleaning
3. Data exploration ## **(visit powerbi file in my github)**
4. Data visualization ## **(visit powerbi file in my github)**
5. Key recommendations


The tool used for the cleaning is microsoft excel and for processing and visualisation i used PowerBI. 
The Excel features I used here include:
Basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, sum, average, percentages etc.), Pivot Tables, 
VLOOKUP, conditionals (IF,REPLACE,COUNTIF,IFS), Filter.
The Powerbi features i used here include:
Data exploration- making measures, used dax , using basic function(calculate,divide,IF,etc..)
Data visualization-(line clustered column chart,column charts, pie charts ,cards, bars,treemap)


### **1. Preliminary Research**
Data analysts may often be required to analyse data in fields they do not have expertise in. To better understand the 
data and give more tangible insight, preliminary research on the industry/business would greatly help. Before working on
the data, I researched customer churn and the telecoms industry. From my research, I understood that churn rate is 
particularly important for the communications industry because the competition is intense, and it is very easy to switch from 
one to another. I also researched zip codes to learn how they work and how they are significant for telecom companies. The
preliminary research helped me overcome my analyst’s block.

### **2. Data Cleaning**
The importance of ensuring data integrity, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, and converting
from one data type to the other cannot be overstated.

In this step, I checked for duplicate values, missing values, wrong formatting, and inconsistent formatting. The dataset
was clean but checking for these gave me confidence in the dataset I needed to proceed to exploration.

### **3. Data exploration**

I enjoyed this part of the analysis. Here, I dug into the data, sliced, diced, and plotted charts to find patterns in 
the data for myself. I observed many patterns in the data, most of which correlated with my research. 

There are 999 customers data's that we are going to explore.
I observed 26.6 per cent of Maven’s customers churned in the last quarter. This was greater than the total amount who joined (14.9%) and resulted in a net loss of 11.7%.
I also found net customers loss(Net customer loss = Total churn rate - Total growth rate).

I found those who subscribed to the month-to-month subscription had much higher churn rates than the 1-year and 2-year subscribers.

The high-value customers churned much less and mainly did the one or two-year subscription. Low-value customers were high-risk customers—they churned quickly—and largely subscribed on a month-to-month basis.
Both month to month and year wise contract segments had similar reasons for quitting, most of which were better competitor offers and dissatisfaction with the service and the price also little concern.

I analysed the top reasons customers gave for leaving. Concernedly, many persons churned because charges might be high and service dissatisfaction.
I dived deep into the top reasons for churn saw that fibre-optic internet service is a source of concern. Some improvements need to be made to the fibre-optic internet service.


### **4. Data visualization**
After exploration, I had the task of arranging the insights gathered in a single-page dashboard. This was the most 
interesting part of the analysis for me. I have files above.

### **5. Key Recommendations**
After the preliminary exploration, I deep-dived into the data to answer three strategic questions to help Maven Communications:
1. How can we convert low-value to high-value customers?
2. What key areas does Maven need to improve on that will have the most effect on churn reduction? 
3. How can they drive growth with a focus on retention?
I found the answers for all these from the data and gave the following recommendations.

#### **Churn minimisation**
1. Aggressively market and incentivise one and two-year plans. This will help us in two ways
- One and two-year plans have the highest retention rate by far
- It would convert low-value customers into high-value customers

2. Improve the internet service, especially Fiber Optic. This would reduce churn due to competitors and dissatisfaction.

#### **Retention-focused growth strategy and reduce some price**
To grow with a focus on retention;
3. Expansion drives should focus on cities with proven high retention rates.

4. Referral bonuses should be given as this will not only drive growth but also
increase the loyalty of customers.
5.Reduction in price may better for regain loyalty of customers.
